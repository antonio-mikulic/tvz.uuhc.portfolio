			<h1 style="	text-align: center; font-size: 3.5em; padding-bottom: 25px;">Antonio Mikulić<br>Student, developer<br>Currently unemployed</h1>
			<p style="text-align: center;">I am a student of informatics and I have been interested in technology from an early age. Any problems I encounter I’ll try to solve with the help of the Internet (in most cases Stack Overflow), most times successfully. From the age of 12 I have tinkered with technology, replaced motherboard and screen on my Nintendo DS, made steering wheel for PC (including manual, gas and brakes) from old joystick etc. As I grew older I became more interested in software and started creating mods for Minecraft and maps for CS 1.6 (PC games). In the third grade of high school I stopped actively engaging in these hobbies. I focused on grades, read about new technologies and my interests, sometimes briefly learning tools and skills that interested me (Blender, Photoshop, server hosting ...). After starting college I started programming again. Currently I’m actively using Linux Fedora (except for programming in C# and using applications that don’t work well with wine), cloud and of course the Internet to help me solve problems. For a little while I researched SEO, WordPress and YouTube for marketing purposes. I’m patient and like helping others solve their problems. I'm good at working in team and to me it is more important to achieve a given goal but to show my skills, however most of my work is done alone. I’m a fast learner and I do not mind sitting at the computer for a longer time.</p>
